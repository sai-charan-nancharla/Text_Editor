##Text Editor GUI with Python

This is a simple text editor GUI created using the Tkinter package in Python. The GUI allows you to create, open, edit, and save text files. It consists of 
three important widgets: two button widgets for saving and closing, and a text box widget for creating and editing text files. The layout is responsive, 
ensuring that the text box widget is resized proportionally when the window is resized.

any additional installation.
